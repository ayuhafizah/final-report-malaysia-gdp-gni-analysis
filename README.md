# 📊 Final Report: Malaysia Real GDP & GNI Analysis using Apache Hive and Python

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a big data analytics workflow using **Apache Hive**, **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**, and **Python** to analyse Malaysia's **Annual Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** and **Gross National Income (GNI)** from **1970 to 2025**.

The project was developed using **Apache Hive** for data storage and querying, while **Google Colab** was used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualisation.

The workflow includes downloading the dataset from OpenDOSM, uploading it into HDFS, managing the data using Apache Hive, and performing exploratory analysis using Python.

| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| abs        | Absolute values of Real GDP and Real GNI |
| growth_yoy | Annual percentage growth rates           |

### Variables

| Variable   | Description                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| series     | Dataset category (Absolute / Growth Rate) |
| date       | Observation year                          |
| gdp        | Real Gross Domestic Product               |
| gni        | Real Gross National Income                |
| gdp_capita | Real GDP per Capita                       |
| gni_capita | Real GNI per Capita                       |

# 🚀 Reproducibility Instructions

### Step 1

Download the **Annual Real GDP & GNI (1970–2025)** dataset from OpenDOSM or use the dataset provided in the `data` folder.

### Step 2

Upload the dataset into the **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**.

### Step 3

Create the Apache Hive database and external table using the SQL commands provided in **`hive_queries.sql`**.

### Step 4

Clone or download this repository and open **`Final_Report_P162895.ipynb`** using **Google Colab**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or another compatible Python environment.

### Step 5

Install the required Python libraries listed in **`requirements.txt`** (only if they are not already installed).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 6

Run all notebook cells sequentially from top to bottom to reproduce the analysis and visualisations.

# ✅ Validation

The dataset was successfully uploaded into HDFS and queried using Apache Hive. The queried data was then analysed using Python to perform feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualisation.

The successful execution of both Apache Hive and Python components demonstrates an effective big data analytics workflow for managing, analysing, and interpreting structured economic data.

# 📝 Notes

- This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) rather than predictive modelling.

- Apache Hive was used for data management, while Python was used for preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and visualisation.

- Running the Apache Hive component of this project requires access to a Hadoop environment with Apache Hive (e.g., HDP Sandbox or an equivalent Hadoop cluster). The Python notebook can be executed independently after the dataset has been exported from Hive.
